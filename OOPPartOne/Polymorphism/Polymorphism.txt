Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other 
by inheritance.

 Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods 
 to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

 For Example:
 1. Animal.java

    class Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

2. Pig.java
    class Pig extends Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }

3. Dog.java
    class Dog extends Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
        }
    }


Here, animalSound() method is used differently.
