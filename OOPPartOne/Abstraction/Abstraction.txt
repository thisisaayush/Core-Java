Abstraction:

a.  It focuses on complex systems of classes. It means it is concerned with the essential properties
    and behaviors of classes. 
b.  It can't be instantiated. 
c.  Abstract method doesn't have a body, body is provided by inherited class.

Abstraction can also be achieved through Interface. Interface class has methods with no body.

To inherit the properties from interface class, use "implements" key in sub-class.

Interface Example:

interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object- Object Instantiation.
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}
