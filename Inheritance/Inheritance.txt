Inheritance in Java- IS-A Relationships.

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit 
properties and behaviors from another class. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the "extends" keyword. 
The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that inherits 
from it is called the subclass or child class.


For Example:

Apple is a fruit. Fruit is a parent class and apple is a sub-class. Apple inherits from fruit class.
