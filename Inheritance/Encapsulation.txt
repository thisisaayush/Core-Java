Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and is a mechanism in 
Java that binds together the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into 
a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation helps in organizing the code in a way that supports modularity 
and information hiding.

Examples:

1. Private Modifiers- Class Attributes.

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // ... constructor, methods, etc.
}

2. Public Methods- Get & Set Methods.

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }

    // ... other methods
}
